Skulpt Google Summer of Code application
===========

##Organization

Skulpt is a python compiler written in javascript. It's mainly used for educatiuonal purposes, it's being used by two universities, Rice and Luther College and an online interactive textbook developed by one of the authors. We are a small team of about 6 active programmers who already do most of the work over the summer. 

The project administrators are: 

* Brad Miller
* Scott Rixner

##Why?

While skulpt is used mostly as a language/runtime for beginners. It's internals are a very good way to learn how compilers work. Students who would help us over the summer would definitelly learn a lot, as they are guided by a team that teaches the whole year through. Next to teaching students about compilers and open source software. It's also benefitial to the project itself. There are several big features waiting to be implemented.
